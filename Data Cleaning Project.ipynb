    "The data being studied is related to patient readmission rates and possible contributing factors. In order to reduce readmissions, thus reducing the fines to hospitals related to readmissions, we need to clean and analyze the data looking for possible ways to reduce patient readmissions. My research question is: does the patients overall satisfaction, based on the survey questions, impact their likelihood of readmission within a month of discharge.\n",

    "## Data Cleaning\n",
    "My goal with my data cleaning plan will be to make the code more readable and understandable, and to identify null and outlier values to address appropriately. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the data cleaning process, I will be using Python to clean the data. Python is regarded as a very easily deployed and readable coding language (Larose, 2019). It has a large amount of community resources to help an individual navigate its packages, making it a versatile tool in data cleaning. I will be utilizing both the NumPy and pandas library to import the data and to carry out various functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will begin by removing extraneous information in the column case number. We will not be calling individually cases during our analyses meaning this column serves us no purpose. Then I will be renaming the survey questions, marked items 1-8, to include a description of what the survey question was asking. Lastly, columns job, income, and marital status could be for the patient or for the primary insurance holder. Without being able to easily identify which individual is being measured, we will not be able to draw conclusions from the data. I will be using the pandas library data frame drop to easily drop all these columns (Pandas Development Team, 2008).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I will re-express categorical columns as numeric values. I will be doing this for each categorical column, not including city, and county. This is due to it being unrealistic, and not beneficial, to re-express these columns due to the high variance in possible answers. Doing this will allow me to quickly analyze each column moving forward. I will be following the method outlined by Larose, by creating a dictionary then replacing values within the column using the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving to outliers, I will use descriptive statistics to look if there are any values (i.e. minimum time spent in hospital) that are obviously being impacted by null values being entered as 0, or another value. I will then identify outliers and missing answers using boxplots to identify possible erroneous data. If data appears to be left blank by patient on a standard yes/no question it will be left as NaN, otherwise I will be filling using Mean Imputation. This will allow me to retain a high level of data available for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plan to Address Null Values\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to find null values we will utilize a count method similar to Mark Needham of Big Data Zone (Needham, 2019). By doing a count of null values in each column, we can see that there are 7 columns that have null values. We will handle these columns differently depending on what kind of data they are conveying. For three of these columns children, soft drink, overweight and anxiety they are self-reported. We will move forward with the reasonable idea that the were left blank by the patient because they are not applicable to that person. This means they will be filled with 0, which references no in our dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the values age and initial days, we will be using the mean value to fill their NaNs. We will accomplish this by using the fillna command. I believe that by filling with mean value, we can still pull accurate observations from the data and avoid dropping sever hundreds of rows. In our analysis, we should strive to keep the most number of observations possible, so we can more successfully mine and draw conclusions from the data collected. Dropping rows should only be used as a last resort where there is not enough information to impute null values from.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outlier Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to identify possible outliers, we will create histograms of columns that we will be using for analysis, or where we feel that it is most likely for outliers to exist. This includes age, children, Vitamin D levels, physician visits, initial days, and full meals eaten. These columns are either going highly likely to be used, or due to the nature of the question such as age, may be misfilled due to a typo.\n",
    "\n",
    "There appears to be quite a few data points lying outside the expected values of the Vitamin D column. We will take a closer look by pulling out rows that have a vitamin D level greater than 30. While there is around 5% of the population reported shown to be outliers, further research shows that a healthy Vitamin D level ranges from 20 ng/ml to 50ng/ml (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2021). This means that these results are within the ranges we would expect to see from a healthy adult.\n"

    "# Data Cleaning Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "Several missing values were identified in the columns Children, Age, soft drink intake, Overweight, Anxiety, and Initial Days spent in hospital. We utilized the mean of the columns where there was a wide range of numeric answers possible, to maintain a high number of rows to be later analyzed. We also concluded that an individual was more likely to leave a question blank if they felt it did not apply to them. Outside of this, there were few anomalies to adress.The apparent outliers in the Vitamin D Levels, were found to be within an acceptable range of possible values upon further research.\n",
    "\n",
    "The justification of using the mean values, or filling answers as a no, comes from our inability to retroactively reach out to the patients to adress the missing values, or rerun testing. In this case I believe there was no better option to maintain the integrity of the data available moving forward.I do not believe that any of the issues that were identified will impact the data question established at the beginning of the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Principal Component Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "For the principal analysis I loaded 11 components. These are the 8 survey responses, days of intial visit, doctor visits, and vitamin d levels. For the survey responses and doctor visits, I believe that the perceived quality of care received would be an innacurate indicator of the level of treatment and service. With an increased level of treatment and face to face time with the doctor, you would logically expect to see lower readmittance. The initial visit length can clue us in to the severity of the original illnes, and the large discrepancy in vitamin d levels observed earlier in the cleaning lead me to conclude that they may play a larger roll in a patients treatment and long term health.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PCA revealed that after 4 components, we do see a high rate of return on additional components. Based on the extracted values, I belive that the following components should be considered 'most important':\n",
    "-Vitamin D Levels (based on PC4)\n",
    "-Initial Days of First Visit (PC3)\n",
    "-Presentation of Options (PC2)\n",
    "-Admission time (PC1)\n",
    "\n",
    "By moving forward with this knowledge the organization can save time and processing power by focusing on the impact of these 4 components.\n",
